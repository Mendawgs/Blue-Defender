# Multi-Organisational System Health and Anomaly Detection Tool

## Overview
The Multi-Organisational System Health and Anomaly Detection Tool is a versatile Python-based solution developed to cater to diverse organisational needs. It is designed to fetch data from various sources, detect anomalies using machine learning techniques, generate system health reports, and integrate Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) for enhanced security insights.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide a generalised tool capable of addressing system health and anomaly detection requirements across multiple organisations. By offering modularity and adaptability, the tool allows for customisations to suit individual organisational contexts and preferences.

## Key Features
- **Data Fetching:** Retrieves data from diverse sources with adaptability for different data repository configurations.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilises machine learning models for anomaly detection, offering flexibility for customisation.
- **Custom Reporting:** Generates comprehensive system health reports adaptable to varying organisational structures and requirements.
- **CTI Integration:** Allows the integration of Cyber Threat Intelligence for improved security insights.

## Benefits
- **Versatility:** Adaptability to various system environments and configurations.
- **Customisation:** Modular design allows organisations to tailor the tool to meet their specific needs.
- **Enhanced Security:** Integration of CTI supports proactive security measures.
